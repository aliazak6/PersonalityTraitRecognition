## Aim:
    We tried to implement a multimodal system for personal trait prediction using ChaLearn First Impressions V2 dataset.
    This project has done for CS559 course in Bilkent. Project paper can be accessible through https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zLyX1MTRbS_fdf3Vl0lFhmexYt5nLLV6/view?usp=sharing
    for extensive information about experimental process. 
## Authors:
    Ali Azak - audio/visual/audiovisual_train.ipynb and audio preprocessing files
    Muhammed Yıldırım - (visual/preprocess_whole_data.ipynb file)
## Contents:
    *.pkl files has annotations for video files.
    train and val folders contains First Impressions v2 dataset.
    It should be noted that these files are not included in repository. One should place dataset here to use repository.
    audio folder includes all the files to create compact embeddings used in regression task, and the training procedure. Contents are described inside the folder.
